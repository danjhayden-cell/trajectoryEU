# Project Management Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines the sustainable practices established for the Trajectory EU project, designed to be simple, efficient, and maintainable for long-term development.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Documentation-First Development
- **CLAUDE.md**: Development context, patterns, and technical decisions
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Git workflow, quality standards, and session management
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Track all significant changes and architectural decisions
- **PRD.md**: Product requirements and feature specifications

### 2. Incremental Progress with Safety Nets
- Commit frequently (every 30-60 minutes of work)
- Create checkpoints before major changes
- Use descriptive commit messages with clear scope
- Maintain working state in main branch

### 3. Quality-First Approach
```bash
# Before major commits
npm run lint && npm run build
```

## 📁 File Organization Strategy

### Component Architecture
```
src/components/
├── trajectory-compare.tsx      # Main app logic
├── charts/                     # Visualization components
├── ui/                        # Reusable UI components
└── [feature]/                 # Feature-specific components
```

### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── PRD.md                     # Product requirements
├── DEVELOPMENT.md             # Development workflow
├── CHANGELOG.md               # Version history
└── PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md      # This file
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Session Pattern
1. **Start**: `git status` → `npm run dev`
2. **Checkpoint**: `git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: before X"`
3. **Develop**: Use TodoWrite for tracking progress
4. **Quality Check**: `npm run lint && npm run build`
5. **Commit**: Descriptive message with scope
6. **End**: Update documentation if needed

### Git Branching Strategy
- **main**: Always deployable, production-ready
- **feature/***: New features and major changes
- **fix/***: Bug fixes and improvements

### Commit Message Format
```
type: brief description

Detailed explanation of changes made:
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Technical improvement 3

```

## 🛟 Backup & Recovery Strategy

### Local Safety
```bash
# Before risky changes
git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: before major refactor"

# Quick recovery
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Discard current changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Keep changes, undo commit
```

### Remote Backup
- Push to GitHub at end of each session
- Tag important milestones
- Maintain clean commit history

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If working directory corrupted
git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -fd

# If need previous version
git log --oneline -10
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

## 📊 Quality Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Linting: `npm run lint`
- Build verification: `npm run build`
- Bundle size monitoring

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All UI controls respond correctly
- [ ] Chart renders smoothly with all scenarios
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] No console errors in development
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable

## 🔧 Claude Code Integration

### CLAUDE.md Maintenance
Update after significant changes:
- New component patterns
- State management approaches
- Performance optimizations
- Common issues and solutions
- Development commands

### Session Documentation
Track in CLAUDE.md:
- Component architecture decisions
- Import path patterns
- TypeScript interface patterns
- Styling system rules
- Performance considerations

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

### Rollback Plan
1. Identify last known good commit: `git log --oneline`
2. Create rollback branch: `git checkout -b rollback-YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Reset to stable state: `git reset --hard <good-commit>`
4. Deploy from rollback branch
5. Investigate issue in separate branch

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Weekly Review
- Review commit history for patterns
- Update documentation with new learnings
- Identify technical debt
- Plan refactoring priorities

### Monthly Assessment
- Evaluate workflow effectiveness
- Update project management practices
- Review and prune old branches
- Assess bundle size and performance

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- Time from idea to implementation
- Frequency of rollbacks needed
- Code review feedback quality

### Code Quality
- TypeScript error frequency
- Build failure rate
- Performance regression detection
- Documentation completeness

### Maintainability
- Ease of onboarding new developers
- Time to understand existing code
- Consistency across components
- Technical debt accumulation rate

## 📝 Next Steps for Sustainability

1. **Automation**: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. **Monitoring**: Add performance tracking
3. **Testing**: Implement automated testing strategy
4. **Documentation**: Regular review and updates
5. **Optimization**: Periodic bundle size and performance audits
